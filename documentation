For the Symbol Table I used a hash table with chaining and for the hash function ascii sum divided by capacity

Scanner: parse every line of the file and put it in the right collection
    -operators, separators and keywords appear in pif file with value -1
    -identifier and constants appear in pif with the position from symbol table
